\section{Future Work}
Our hope is that we can improve upon the rates achieved in multiple access channel, by offsetting the transmition of the users by half symbol duration.
With usual multiple access we get no information about the symbol if the users produce different symbols. But we can see that even without any coding, we can
have a better idea of the symbols if both the users are offset by half a symbol duration. The idea is to sample this stream at twice the sample rate.
Message passing rules have to be developed for this scenario.

Currently some of the modules in the implementation are quite slow. Especially construction of encoder from given parity check matrix. We would strive to
improve the performance of encoder by implementing sparse LU decomposition. Another improvement that is in order is to develop VOLK 
libraries for 
the GNU Radio implementation of the encoder and decoder.
