\section{Motivation}
\label{motivation}
Coding Theory is one of the foundations of Communication Engineering.
Search for better and better codes has always been an area of intense research.
For a long time there was a significant gap between the theoretical capacity and practically achievable capacity.
It is proved that LDPC codes introduced by Gallager, form a class of capacity approaching codes.
The research in that area was dormant for a long time till they were rediscovered in the late 1990s\cite{kay}.
It is shown that these codes decoded with iterative decoding algorithms like sum-product algorithm\cite{kay} or 
message passing algorithms\cite{mct} achieve good error performance.

GNU Radio provides a free and open-source platform for implementing practical communication systems 
using various compatible hardware like USRP, and also provides a learning and simulation tool.
The use of GNU Radio in research related to Software Defined Radio, Digital Signal Processing
and Communication Engineering is becoming increasingly widespread.
In this project we implement a generic encoder and decoder for LDPC codes in GNU Radio and
also implement algorithms for construction of LDPC codes.
